rock paper scissors

Coding the Rock Paper Scissors project reminded me a lot about when I coded in PERL. Perhaps, an expression of my personal programming style.
There were things I imagined for my version of the project, but I had to learn more about coding in Js. More about what it could, and ultimately, couldn't, do. After spending a great deal of time trying "this" and "that", I settled for a much simpler version.
Perhaps I can revisit this assignment in the future and either enhance this version with better Js-ing, or add some PHP features to achieve my desired outcome. For now, I hope you enjoy what I have accomplished thus far.
If there are any glitches, please drop me a line so I can "fix" them.
Thank you! 



oh! Yes, please upvote my project on TOP.  :)
